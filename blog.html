      <p>The <span>Sloga</span> was formed in 1956 in Gornji Vakuf.Color of the jerseys are red and white.
        The club struggled for a long time, until 2015, when the town is getting a sport hall for training.
        After that moment everything changed for this small club. It finally goes to <span>the first league of the country</span>,
        which brings a lot of happiness to everyone who lives for handball.</p>
